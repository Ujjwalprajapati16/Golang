# Golang

Golang is a compiled language, which means that it is compiled to machine code before it is executed.
Golang is a statically typed language, which means that the type of a variable is known at compile time.

## Notes on Golang

### Key Features
- **Concurrency**: Golang has built-in support for concurrent programming with goroutines and channels.
- **Garbage Collection**: Automatic memory management helps prevent memory leaks.
- **Standard Library**: Extensive standard library with packages for various tasks like web development, cryptography, and I/O operations.
- **Cross-Platform**: Golang can be compiled to run on multiple operating systems including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Common Commands
- `go run <file.go>`: Compile and run a Go program.
- `go build <file.go>`: Compile a Go program and create an executable.
- `go test`: Run tests in the current package.
- `go fmt`: Format Go source code.

### Basic Topics
- **Variables and Constants**: Declaration and initialization of variables and constants.
- **Data Types**: Understanding basic data types like int, float, string, and bool.
- **Control Structures**: Using if-else, switch-case, and loops (for).
- **Functions**: Defining and calling functions, understanding parameters and return values.
- **Error Handling**: Using error type and handling errors in Go.

### Intermediate Topics
- **Structs**: Defining and using structs to create custom data types.
- **Methods**: Associating functions with structs to define methods.
- **Interfaces**: Defining and implementing interfaces for polymorphism.
- **Packages**: Organizing code into packages and importing them.
- **Concurrency**: Using goroutines and channels for concurrent programming.

### Advanced Topics
- **Reflection**: Using reflection to inspect types at runtime.
- **Generics**: Understanding and using generics (available in Go 1.18+).
- **Testing**: Writing unit tests and benchmarks using the testing package.
- **Profiling and Optimization**: Profiling Go programs and optimizing performance.
- **Advanced Concurrency**: Using sync package for advanced concurrency patterns.
